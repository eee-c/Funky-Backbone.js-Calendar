= Funky, Funky, Backbone.js Calendar

This is the code that I am using to explore Backbone.js in http://japhr.blogspot.com[my blog].

== Installation

*Requirements:* the backend server and data store requires only node.js (0.6+) and npm.

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git://github.com/eee-c/Funky-Backbone.js-Calendar.git`
2. In the repo, install dependencies: `npm install`

There is no step three!  You can run the server with:

----
node app
----

== This is NOT good code

This is exploratory, learning code.  I do some good things, some bad things.  I am only making it available because some people have asked.

If you are looking for good Backbone.js code, check out my book, http://recipeswithbackbone.com[Recipes with Backbone], co-authored with http://www.ngauthier.com/[Nick Gauthier].
