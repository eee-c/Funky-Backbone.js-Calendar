= Funky, Funky, Backbone.js Calendar

This is the code that I am using to explore Backbone.js in http://japhr.blogspot.com[my blog].

The backend is written in node.js and requires express.js and the jade package for templating.

The backend storage is CouchDB.

== This is NOT good code

This is exploratory, learning code.  I do some good things, some bad things.  I am only making it available because some people have asked.

If you are looking for good Backbone.js code, check out my book, http://recipeswithbackbone.com[Recipes with Backbone], co-authored with http://www.ngauthier.com/[Nick Gauthier].
