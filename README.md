# Funky, Funky, Backbone.js Calendar

This is the code that I am using to explore Backbone.js while researching [Recipes with Backbone](http://recipeswithbackbone.com).

The backend is written in node.js and requires express.js and the jade package for templating.

The backend storage is [node-dirty](https://github.com/felixge/node-dirty).

## Dart!

This is the [Dart](http://dartlang.org) exploration branch. I am exploring testing Backbone.js applications with Dart's amazing unit testing.

To run tests, install Dart (obviously), then:

```bash
pub install
./test/run.sh
```

That's it!

## This is NOT good code

This is exploratory, learning code.  I do some good things, some bad things.  I am only making it available because some people have asked.

If you are looking for good Backbone.js code, check out my book, [Recipes with Backbone](http://recipeswithbackbone.com), co-authored with [Nick Gauthier](http://www.ngauthier.com/).
